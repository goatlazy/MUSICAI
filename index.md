__Leverage Large Language Model on Conditional Music Generation__
{:.center .larger}

## Introduction
Pretraining on large-scale noisy data followed by fine-tuning on the target domain has proven highly successful in numerous tasks. In light of this, our objective is to construct a cutting-edge model for symbolic music by leveraging the extensive symbolic music dataset available from the MuseScore forum.

The aim of this subjective listening test is to assess the performance of our proposed model. Specifically, we are interested in determining whether the proposed model can achieve controllability while maintaining high-quality musical output. In this questionnaire, you will be guided to listen to various samples generated by different machine learning models. Your task will be to evaluate the music's quality, considering factors such as coherence, richness, and arrangement. Additionally, we kindly request you to assess whether our model achieves the desired level of controllability. Completing the survey is estimated to take approximately 20 minutes, but you are free to skip any remaining questions at your convenience.

We sincerely appreciate your participation in this survey, and we welcome any comments and suggestions you may have!

### Genre-informed generation samples 

> __Settings__: The model is provided with a structured music data format, starting with a 'start-of-song' event, followed by a 'start-of-tags' marker. The 'start-of-tags' marker is followed by genre tags that describe the music. Finally, the 'start-of-notes' marker indicates the commencement of a sequence of instrument codes, representing musical notes and instrument selections

### Program-informed generation samples

> __Settings__: The model is provided with a structured music data format, starting with a 'start-of-song' event, followed by a 'start-of-program' marker. The 'start-of-program' marker is followed by programs that are used in the music. Finally, the 'start-of-notes' marker indicates the commencement of a sequence of instrument codes, representing musical notes and instrument selections

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

2A | __Ensemble__: piano, flute, cello | {% include audio_player.html filename="audio/program_cond/0_instrument_conditioned.mp3" %} |
2B | __Ensemble__: piano, trumpet, harmonica, guitar, bass and violin | {% include audio_player.html filename="audio/program_cond/2_instrument_conditioned.mp3" %} |
2C | __Ensemble__: voices, piano,  | {% include audio_player.html filename="audio/program_cond/1_instrument_conditioned.mp3" %} |
2D | __Ensemble__: recorder | {% include audio_player.html filename="audio/program_cond/4_instrument_conditioned.mp3" %} |
2E | __Ensemble__: church-organ, trombone, tuba, horn | {% include audio_player.html filename="audio/program_cond/3_instrument_conditioned.mp3" %} |

</div>

### Program-genre-informed generation samples

> __Settings__: In this context, there exist five distinctive data event types: 'start-of-song,' 'start-of-program,' 'start-of-tags,' 'start-of-notes,' and 'end-of-song.' The 'start-of-program' event serves as an indicator for the initiation of a program list, while the 'start-of-tags' event marks the commencement of a tag list. Meanwhile, the 'start-of-notes' event signifies the outset of a sequence of music notes.

## Unconditioned generation 

> __Settings__: Only a `start-of-song' event is provided to the model. The model generates the instrument list and subsequently the note sequence.
