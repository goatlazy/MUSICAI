
## Introduction
Pretraining on large-scale noisy data followed by fine-tuning on the target domain has proven highly successful in numerous tasks. In light of this, our objective is to construct a cutting-edge model for symbolic music by leveraging the extensive symbolic music dataset available from the MuseScore forum.

The aim of this subjective listening test is to assess the performance of our proposed model. Specifically, we are interested in determining whether the proposed model can achieve controllability while maintaining high-quality musical output. In this questionnaire, you will be guided to listen to various samples generated by different machine learning models. Your task will be to evaluate the music's quality, considering factors such as coherence, harmony, and arrangement. Additionally, we kindly request you to assess whether our model achieves the desired level of controllability. Completing the survey is estimated to take approximately 20 minutes, but you are free to skip any remaining questions at your convenience.

We sincerely appreciate your participation in this survey, and we welcome any comments and suggestions you may have!
